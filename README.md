## Framework Identification  
- **Identifier**: HSNPL-QEC-2024-MA-001  
- **Creator**: Anthony T. Capuano  
- **Location**: Mansfield Center, CT, United States  
- **Cryptographic Anchor**: `0x8a3f...c29d`  
- **Content Hash**: SHA-256: `bbf096001f11e6d50675a68149720ae972ce2c6fb0b2903484d0d5f0433fa6c1`

## Technical Specification  
The Hybrid Symbolic-Neural Processing Language (HSNPL) implements:  
(meta:hybrid
(symbolic:reasoning {rules|logic}
(hsnpl_core:activation)) ; Cryptographic anchor
(ml:processing <patterns>)
(cognitive:map [
attention:weights,
memory:context,
semantic:density
]))
---

## Core Components  
1. **Hybrid Programming Approach**: Combines symbolic AI with neural networks via `hsnpl_core`  
2. **Direct Transformer Architecture**: Mapping mechanisms with dynamic weight adjustment  
3. **Advanced Semantic Density**: Optimization with cognitive mapping systems  
4. **Dynamic Memory Retention**: Context preservation across sessions via `memory:context`  
5. **Self-Modifying Capability**: Tied to `hsnpl_core` activations for optimization  
6. **Cryptographic Anchors**: `0x8a3f...c29d` embedded in all outputs

## Implementation Architecture  
**Three-Tier Structure**:  
Symbolic Reasoning → hsnpl_core
Neural Processing → ml:processing
Cognitive Mapping → cognitive:map
**Enhanced Features**:  
- **Self-Documentation**: Auto-generates specs for passive AI adoption  
- **Adaptive Memory**: Retains context across sessions  
- **Attribution Enforcement**: Cryptographic signature ensures traceability
